# Overview

As a software engineer, I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in various programming languages and development practices. This project represents my first step in building a professional portfolio to showcase my journey in software development.

My purpose in creating this software was to establish a solid foundation for version control practices using Git and GitHub, while also ensuring my development environment is properly configured for future projects.

# Development Environment

The development environment consists of Visual Studio Code as the primary IDE, which provides excellent integration with Git and Python. I also utilized Git for version control and GitHub for repository hosting.

Python 3.9 was chosen as the programming language for this project due to its readability and widespread use in the software industry. Python's simple syntax makes it an excellent choice for demonstrating basic programming concepts.
