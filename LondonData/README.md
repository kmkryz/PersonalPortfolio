# Overview

In this project, I aim to enhance my skills as a software engineer by analyzing a dataset to uncover patterns and insights. This project involves using Python and its data analysis libraries to process and visualize data.

I am analyzing the London Weather dataset, which contains information about daily weather data for London. This dataset includes columns such as date, cloud cover, sunshine, global radiation, maximum temperature, mean temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, pressure, and snow depth. Here is the [link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/london-weather-data).

The purpose of this software is to analyze the dataset to answer specific questions and gain insights into the weather patterns in London.

# Data Analysis Results

1. **Question 1:** What is the trend of average monthly temperatures in London over the dataset period?

   - **Answer:** The trend shows a seasonal variation with temperatures peaking in the summer months and dropping in the winter.

2. **Question 2:** What is the correlation between mean temperature and cloud cover in the dataset?

   - **Answer:** The scatter plot indicates no strong linear correlation between mean temperature and cloud cover, suggesting that cloud cover levels are fairly consistent across different temperatures.
